/*!
	Function: If_Statements()
		Creates a Control of Flow block. The commands enclosed within the If Statement and EndIf will only be executed if the evaluated statement returns TRUE, which can be a number different than 0 or a non-empty string.  

	Parameters:
		Options DropdownList - Selects the statement to evaluate. If the statement resolves to true the commands inside below the If Statement will be executed, otherwise they will be skipped until *EndIf* or an *Else* is reached.  
			For *Compare Variables* the VarName to the left of the operator should NOT be enclosed in percent signs, only the variables to the right of it must use them.  
			The operators accepted are:  
			> =, ==, <>, !=, >, <, >=, <=.
			*Evaluate Expression* can evaluate any valid expression as true or false. Variables must NOT be enclosed in percent signs. For more information see [Expressions](p6-Variables.html#expressions).
		Add Else - Add an *Else* Statement. If the If Statement above it resolves to false the commands below it will be executed instead, otherwise they will be skipped until *EndIf* is reached. This should be placed before the *EndIf*.
		Else If - Creates an *Else If* statement, which means that the statement must be inside another If block and will be evaluated only if the If before it evaluates to false. When this option is checked the *EndIf* row will not be created.

	Remarks:
		To evaluate two or more statements you can use the *Evaluate Expression* option as it supports multiple statements (e.g. Var > 10 && Var < 20) or you can add them in sequence in the list, each one with a corresponding EndIf.  
		
		For more details on usage with other commands see [Variables](p6-Variables.html).

			> X := Today is %A_DD%. ; And it's necessary to enclose variables in percent signs.
		Expression - If checked, the value will be considered an expression. You can enter any valid expression, which may contain strings enclosed in quotes, variables (not enclosed in percent signs), numbers, math operations, functions and object references, including creating arrays.
			> X := FoundX + 100 ; Assigns X to the value of FoundX + 100.
			> X := InStr("AutoHotkey", "y") + 4 ; Assigns X to 14.
			> X := [10, 20, 30, "String", Variable] ; Creates an array.
			> X := Array(1, 2, 3) ; Creates an array with the Array function.
			> Y := X[1] ; Assigns Y to the first value in the X array.
			> Y += 1 ; Increments Y by 1.
			> X := {Name: "John", Age: 25}) ; Creates an associative array.
			> X[Name] := "George" ; Sets the "Name" element of X to "George".
			> X.Age += 2 ; Adds 2 to the "Age" element of X.

/*!
	Function: Functions()
		Executes a Function and assigns the result to a Variable. You can also call object methods in this window.  

	Parameters:
		Output Variable (Optional) - Name of the Variable in which to store the contents.
		Array Object - If checked, the name of an Array/Object on which to call the method.
		Use Function from External File - Check this option to select an AutoHotkey Script File (.ahk) containing one or more functions to be used. This feature requires [AutoHotkey](http://autohotkey.com/) installed.  
			See Remarks below for more information.  
		Function Name - A valid AHK Built-in Function, an existing [User-Defined function](p7-Functions.html#user-defined-functions) or one in the selected external .ahk file.
		Comma separated parameters - The list of parameters for the function.  
			*Notes*:  
			* Input only the parameters values, without parenthesis.  
			* Use [Expression](p6-Variables.html#expressions) format.  
			* Do NOT enclose variables in percent signs.  
			* Strings MUST be enclosed in quotes.  
			* Omitted optional parameters will use their default values.  
			> InStr("AutoHotkey", "o", , , 2)
			The function above have 5 possible parameters. In this example parameters 3 and 4 will use the default values.  

	Remarks:
		AutoHotkey's Built-in Functions are supported by default. You can also define your own functions inside PMC in [User-Defined functions](p7-Functions.html#user-defined-functions) window and run functions from external AutoHotkey Script Files, if you have [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) installed.  

	Extra:
		### External Functions
			If a *Standard Library File* is configured it will be automatically loaded when a new command is added.  
			
			When you load an external file the program will try to detect possible function names and list them in *Function Name* field. If the function you want doesn't appear in the list you can still type it manually.  
			
			When this feature is used in Playback it will create a temporary .ahk file in the same directory where Macro Creator is installed and run it using AutoHotkey. The result will be copied to the Output Variable and the script will be closed.  
			
			If the ahk file containing the function have #include directives they must contain the absolute path for the included files (e.g.: #include c:\lib\myfunction.ahk).  
			
			Since those functions are not loaded with Macro Creator they may take longer to execute.
			
			**Note**: This feature is limited and can only return 1 string/number value. It's recommended to use [User-Defined Functions](p7-Functions.html#user-defined-functions) instead.

	Function: COM_Interface()
		Select Application (Advanced) allows to create any COM Object and add commands in AutoHotkey's dotted syntax format.

	Parameters:
		CLSID - CLSID or human-readable Prog ID of the COM object to create.
		Connect - Tries to connect to the Last Active COM Object registered to the selected CLSID to be used for the current session.
		Handle - Name of a Handle that will point to the object.
		Output Variable (Optional) - Name of the variable in which to store the result of COM Script.
		COM Script - Command line in AutoHotkey's dotted syntax to execute using the object. **Ommit the Handle from the beginning of the string**.  

	Remarks:
		You can enter multiple commands one by line (you can't assign variables this way).  
		
		The syntax for COM commands is the same as in AutoHotkey scripts except for:  
			* Variables MUST be enclosed in percent signs.
			* Strings must NOT be enclosed in quotes.
		
		To set a blank value use a pair of quotes: ""
		
		When you close the application, all references to Active Objects will be lost. To continue working using saved project files you must reconnect to the application by either editing one of the lines containing each handle and use the *Connect* button to re-create all references, or assigning the Handle to a ComObj function, usually ComObjActive(), though it will not work on all applications.
		
		To assign a value to the command use the *:=* operator. For example:
		> ActiveCell.Value := 100
		
		Self-references inside parameters are supported. In such cases **you must NOT ommit the Handle** from the parameter.
		> Range(Xl.Selection, Xl.Selection.Offset(5, 5)).Select
		
		To create a SafeArray enclose the values in blocks [].
		> Selection.Subtotal(2, -4157, [4, 5], 1, 0, 1)
		
		To use *ComObjMissing()* leave the parameter blank:
		> Function(1, 2, , 3, , 5)
		An exported script from the above example would be like:
		> Function(1, 2, ComObjMissing(), 3, ComObjMissing(), 5)
